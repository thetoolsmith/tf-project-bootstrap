# tf-project-bootstrap
Generic but opinionated terraform project bootstrapper.

Examples, patterns with implementation code demonstrating one way to build a re-usable Terraform provisioning system for any organization.

Some AWS resources have been implemented in this example framework (eks, s3 secrets etc...). The idea is to follow the patterns used here for file organization structure, execution methodology and build on top of this to create an organization specific Infrastructure provisioning framework.

The Terraform created here can also be used as a reference and guide to managing data through some of Terraforms more advanced features and capabilities.
